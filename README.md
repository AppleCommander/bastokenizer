# BASIC Tokenizer

This project is an offshoot of AppleCommander's import of a BASIC program.  The tooling will have more capabilities than what is available in AppleCommander.  

# Subprojects

This project is split into two sub-projects:

* [api](api) is the Java API
* [bt](tools/bt) is a command-line tool for tokenizing AppleSoft BASIC programs.
