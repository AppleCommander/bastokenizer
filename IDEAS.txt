Ideas
=====

* Get simple solution working.
* Allow removal of REM statements.
* Allow code comments (' for basic?) that don't make it into resulting code.
* Compress lines to some maximum byte size.  Needs to be aware of line numbers and references.
* Remove line numbers and use labels.
* Move constants to variables.
* Optimize expressions
